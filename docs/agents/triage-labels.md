# Triage Labels

The triage skills use five canonical roles. This file maps those roles to the
labels configured in this repository's tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`              | `needs-triage`        | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`                | `needs-info`          | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`           | `ready-for-agent`     | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`           | `ready-for-human`     | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                   | `wontfix`              | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (for example, "apply the AFK-ready triage label"),
use the corresponding label string from this table.

The tracker currently also has `bug`, `documentation`, `duplicate`,
`enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, `question`,
`dependencies`, and `docker` labels. Use these as categorization labels, not
as replacements for the five workflow roles above.
