# Homestation Service Inventory

This inventory is a human-oriented map of the services currently configured for
`homestation`. The Nix configuration is authoritative; update this table in the
same change whenever an app is added, removed, renamed, or its exposure changes.

`Public` means the homelab module includes the app in Cloudflare Tunnel ingress.
It does not imply anonymous access: each service may still require its own
authentication. `Private` apps are available through the local HTTPS ingress
but are excluded from generated tunnel ingress. `Internal` apps have no app
hostname.

Glance also links to `backup.npham.de`, but no corresponding homelab app is
declared in this repository. Its ownership and operation are therefore outside
this inventory.

Glance auth secrets (user, password hash, secret key) and the GitHub token are
not passed as environment variables: Docker Compose interpolates `$` sequences
in `env_file` values, which corrupts bcrypt password hashes. They are rendered
as individual sops templates and bind-mounted into the container under
`/run/secrets/`, consumed via Glance's `${secret:NAME}` config syntax.
